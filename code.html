                    In this lesson, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of the Internet and
                    the World Wide Web (WWW). Before you start your journey into web development,
                    it's crucial to have a solid grasp of these concepts, as they form the backbone
                    of the digital world.
                </p>

                <h3>What is the Internet?</h3>

                <p>
                    The Internet, short for "interconnected networks," is a global network of
                    computers and devices that communicate with each other through a standardized
                    set of protocols. It's a vast, decentralized network that connects millions of
                    computers worldwide, enabling them to share information and resources
                    seamlessly. Think of the Internet as the infrastructure that makes online
                    communication and data exchange possible.
                </p>

                <h3>The World Wide Web (WWW)</h3>

                <p>
                    The World Wide Web, often referred to as the "Web," is a subset of the Internet.
                    It's a system of interconnected documents and resources linked by hyperlinks and
                    URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). When you open a web browser and access a
                    website, you are interacting with the World Wide Web.
                </p>

                <h4>Key points about the World Wide Web:</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web Pages:</strong> Web pages are the building blocks of the Web.
                        They are documents containing text, images, videos, and other multimedia
                        elements. Each web page has a unique address called a URL.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> Hyperlinks (or links) are clickable elements
                        within web pages that allow you to navigate between different web pages and
                        websites. They are the foundation of how information is interconnected on
                        the Web.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Web browsers are software applications (e.g.,
                        Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that allow users to access and view web pages. They
                        interpret HTML and CSS to render web content.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

                <p>
                    The Internet and the World Wide Web work together to deliver web content to your
                    device. Here's a simplified overview of the process:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>You Request a Web Page:</strong> When you enter a URL (e.g.,
                        www.example.com) in your web browser's address bar and press Enter, you're
                        requesting a specific web page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Request is Sent:</strong> Your request travels through a series
                        of routers and servers to reach the web server hosting the requested page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Web Server Responds:</strong> The web server processes your
                        request, retrieves the requested web page, and sends it back to your
                        browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rendering the Page:</strong> Your web browser receives the web
                        page's HTML, CSS, and other assets and renders them on your screen, creating
                        the visual web page you see.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The Internet vs. The World Wide Web</h3>

                <p>
                    It's important to note that the Internet and the World Wide Web are not the
                    same:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Internet:</strong> The infrastructure and global network of
                        interconnected devices and networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>World Wide Web:</strong> A system of interconnected web pages and
                        resources accessed through web browsers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Understanding this distinction will be valuable as you continue your journey
                    into web development.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>
                    In this lesson, we've laid the foundation for your web development journey by
                    introducing you to the concepts of the Internet and the World Wide Web. These
                    concepts are essential to comprehend as you dive deeper into web development,
                    where you'll create and manipulate web pages within this interconnected digital
                    realm.
